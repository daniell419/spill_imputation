#' Simulate Panel Data with Treatment and Spillover Effects
#'
#' This function generates a panel dataset for a difference-in-differences (DiD) setup
#' with treatment assignment, fixed effects, and spillover effects from treated "friends."
#'
#' @param n_units Integer. Number of units (individuals, regions, etc.). Default is 500.
#' @param n_periods Integer. Number of time periods. Default is 6.
#' @param treatment_period Integer. Period in which treatment begins. Default is 4.
#' @param treatment_effect Numeric. Effect size of the treatment on treated units. Default is 5.
#' @param spillover_effect Numeric. Effect size per treated friend in post-treatment periods. Default is 1.
#' @param seed Integer. Random seed for reproducibility. Default is 123.
#'
#' @return A `data.frame` with the following columns:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{y}{Outcome variable including fixed effects, treatment, spillover, and noise.}
#'   \item{not_exposed}{Binary indicator equal to 1 if the unit has 0 treated friends.}
#'   \item{id}{Unit identifier.}
#'   \item{time}{Time period.}
#'   \item{treat_group}{Binary indicator equal to 1 if the unit is in the treated group.}
#' }
